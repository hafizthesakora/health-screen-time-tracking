1. Actual Screen Monitoring:

   - Uses Windows API calls to detect:
     - Last input time (keyboard/mouse)
     - Monitor state
     - Active windows
     - System idle time
   - Tracks multiple monitors
   - Detects true screen activity vs. idle state

2. Enhanced Logging:

   - Detailed screen state logging
   - Session tracking
   - Active periods
   - Reminder history
   - JSON-formatted detailed logs

3. Improved Activity Detection:

   - Considers screen active only when:
     - User input within last 5 minutes
     - Monitors are powered on
     - There's an active window
     - System is not idle

4. Multiple Log Files:
   - screen_state.log: Detailed monitor state
   - detailed_log.json: Comprehensive activity tracking
   - current_session.json: Current session information
   - reminder_log.csv: Exercise reminder history

To test the monitoring:

1. Run as administrator:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
.\ScreenTimeMonitor.ps1
```

2. Test scenarios:

   - Normal active use
   - Lock screen
   - Screen saver
   - Monitor power off
   - System idle

3. Check logs:

```powershell
Get-Content "$env:ProgramData\ScreenTimeMonitor\$env:COMPUTERNAME\screen_state.log" -Tail 10
Get-Content "$env:ProgramData\ScreenTimeMonitor\$env:COMPUTERNAME\detailed_log.json" -Tail 1
```

The script now accurately tracks:

- True screen activity time
- User presence
- Monitor state
- System idle time
- Multiple monitor setups

Would you like me to:

1. Adjust the activity detection parameters?
2. Add more detailed logging?
3. Implement additional monitoring features?
4. Add specific activity patterns tracking?
